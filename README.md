<h1>LabSchool</h1>
<p>Project developed during Senai's DEVinHouse Course (2022/2023).</p>
</br>
<p>System developed in C#, using SQL Server Express Database and REST API. The system stores, shows, changes and deletes records of students, teachers and pedagogues in a database that simulates a school's database. </p>
</br>
<p>There is a Migration with initial data loading.</p>
</br>
<p><b>Note:</b> 
It was an application requirement that the CPF field appear as a long type. However, the long type does not accept numbers starting with 0. Thus, for student registration, a verification was created that accepts CPFs with 11 digits and also with 10 digits for CPFs starting with 0.<p>
